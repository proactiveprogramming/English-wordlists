(2) A digit indicating the specific branch of law, as follows: 

2 Constitutional and administrative law 

3 Military, defense, tax, economic law 

4 Social, labor, welfare, health, safety, education, cultural law 

5 Criminal law 

6 Private law 

7 Civil procedure and courts 

8 Laws (Statutes), regulations, cases 

(3) A group of digits beginning with indicating a topic subordinate to the 
specific branch of law 

Example: 05 Procedure (under 5 Criminal law) 

(4) Notation from Table 2 indicating the jurisdiction or place 

Example: 94 Australia 

(continued) 
392

Arrange these elements as follows: 

(1) Base number 34 

(2) Notation for the branch of law 

(4) Notation from Table 2 for jurisdiction or place 

(3) Notation for the subordinate topic in the branch of law, e.g., criminal

(Option A: To give local emphasis and a shorter notation to the law of a specific 
jurisdiction or area, arrange the elements as follows: 

(1) Base number 34 

(2) Notation for the branch of law 

(3) Notation for subordinate topic, e.g., (assuming Australia to be the 
jurisdiction given preferred treatment), criminal procedure of Australia 
345.05 

(To class the law of a jurisdiction subordinate to the emphasized jurisdiction or 
area, insert between 2) and 3) a shortened notation from Table 2 derived by 
dropping from the given area number for a jurisdiction all digits that apply to larger 
areas. For instance, the number for criminal procedure of New South Wales, a state 
of Australia, e.g., 345.405. For subordinate jurisdictions of a country with irregular 
notation, i.e., each country the number for whose subdivisions are coordinate with 
the number for the entire country (e.g., the Sudan having notation 624, the 
provinces of the Sudan having notation 625-629), add to the three digits that part 
of the notation from Table 2 that changes, e.g., criminal procedure of the Darfur 
region 345.705. Add 00 before adding notation for Table 1 to general works on the 
law of a jurisdiction or area, e.g., a directory of lawyers in Australia 349.40025 

(Class comprehensive works on the law of the preferred jurisdiction or area in 342, 
comparative law and the law of other jurisdictions and areas in 349

(4) Notation from Table 2, followed by a 

(2) Notation for the branch of law 

(3) Notation for the subordinate topic without the initial 0, e.g., criminal 
procedure of Australia 349.4055, of New South Wales 349.44055, 
texts of the welfare laws of Sydney 349.44104302632. Add 00 before 
adding notation from Table 1 to general works on the law of a 
jurisdiction or area, e.g., a directory of lawyers in Australia 349.40025 

(Class comparative law in 342 where full instructions are given 

(Option C: Class law of a specific discipline or subject with the discipline or 
subject, using notation 026 from Table 1, e.g., law of education 370.26)
