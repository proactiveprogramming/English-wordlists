appear in Volume 1 in this edition 

(Option: Distinguish scores by prefixing a letter or other symbol to the number for 
treatises, e.g., music for violin M787.2 or &787.2, and distinguish miniature scores 
from other scores by a special prefix, e.g., MM787.2; distinguish recordings in a 
similar manner, e.g., violin recordings R787.2 or MR787.2. Alternatively, 
distinguish scores, texts, recordings by adding to the number for treatises the 
numbers following 78 in 780.26-780.269, e.g., miniature scores of music for violin 
787.20265. Examples in this schedule do not distinguish scores, texts, or

> 785.6-785.9 Ensembles consisting of only one instrumental group 

The inclusion of "only one kind" in the 785.6-785.9 headings limits the 
subdivisions to individual kind of instruments, not to family of instruments. 
For example, a string quartet, which usually consists of two violins, a viola, and 
a cello is classed in 785.7194 string quartets, not 785.72194 violin quartets 

When adding from 786-788 to indicate the instrument, add only the notation 
for the instrument; do not follow the footnote leading to add instructions. After 
indicating the instrument, add as instructed under 785.2-785.9, where notation 
19 is used to indicate size of ensemble. For example, 785.7194 means string 
quartets, not string instruments of Europe (the meaning that would result from 
following the footnote instruction). The correct number for string quartets of 
Europe is 785.7194094

Class here music for solo instrument, music for solo instruments accompanied 
by one other instrument when accompanying instrument clearly has a subsidiary 
role 

Unless the forerunner of a modern instrument has its own notation, class it with 
the modern instrument. For example, the shawm, a forerunner of the oboe and 
an instrument without its own number, is classed with the oboe in 788.52; 
however, the vihuela, the forerunner of the guitar, is classed in 787.86 (its own
