literature of that language) 

Unless there is a specific provision for a dialect, literature in a dialect is classed 
with the literature of the basic language

more of its vocabulary comes than from its other source language(s) 

(Option: For any group of literatures, add 04 and then add notation 01-89 from 
Table 3-B, e.g., collections of lyric poetry written in African languages 
896.0410408) 

(Option: To give preferred treatment to, or make available more and shorter 
numbers for the classification of, literature of any specific language that it is 
desired to emphasize, use one of the following options: 

(Option A: Class in 810, where full instructions appear 

(Option B: Give preferred treatment by placing before 810 through use of a 
letter or other symbol, e.g., literature of Arabic language 8A0, for which the 
base number is 8A 

(Option C: Where two or more countries share the same language, either [1] 
use initial letters to distinguish the separate countries, or [2] use the special 
number designated for literatures of those countries that are not preferred. 
Full instructions appear under 810, 819, 820, 828.99, 840.1-848.9, 848.99,

Under each literature identified by *, add to designated base number notation 
1-8 from Table 3-A for works by or about individual authors, notation 01-89 
from Table 3-B for works by or about more than one author. If the base 
number is not identified in a note, it is the number given for the literature, e.g., 
for Dutch 839.31. Full instructions for building numbers are given at the start of 
Table 3 

The numbers used in this schedule for literatures of individual languages do not 
necessarily correspond exactly with those in 420-490 or with the notation in
