Publisher's Foreword 



The year 1988 witnessed two events which will have a profound effect on the future of 
the Dewey Decimal Classification and other general classification systems. Curiously, 
both events took place on the same day. 

On July 29, a computer tape containing substantially all of the text of DDC 20 was 
delivered to a firm in Massachusetts to begin production of this edition. The intellectual 
content of that tape was the result of ten years of intensive effort by the editorial group at 
the Library of Congress, numerous committees and advisors, and input from DDC users 
throughout the world. The computer tape itself was produced by the editors using a 
sophisticated microcomputer-based editorial support system and the DDC Database. 

On the same date, Forest Press and the Dewey Decimal Classification became a part of 
the OCLC Online Computer Library Center, the Ohio-based not-for-profit organization 
which provides computer services and products to more than 8,000 libraries through a 
network which extends to Europe and Asia. Joining the DDC with the talents and 
resources of OCLC will allow the development of the computer products and services 
which are needed by DDC users. 

DDC 20 itself represents an effort to meet the requirements of today while preparing 
for the needs of the future. In compiling this edition, Forest Press has had the advice and 
assistance of many persons in the library community. 

Until July 29, Forest Press was a division of the Lake Placid Education Foundation. 
Editorial work on DDC 20 was thus completed under the guidance of the Forest Press 
Committee, appointed by the Trustees of the Foundation. The Committee included, in 
addition to members representing the Foundation's Board of Trustees, the following 
members representing library concerns: Walter W. Curley, Chairperson, former President 
of Gaylord Bros., Inc.; Richard W. Gardner, Professor of Library and Information Sci- 
ence, University of Montreal; Joseph H. Howard, Director, National Agricultural Library; 
John A. Humphry, former Executive Director, Forest Press; J. Michael O'Brien, Execu- 
tive Director, Suburban Library System, Burr Ridge, Illinois; Peter J. Paulson, Executive 
Director, Forest Press; David Penniman, Director, Libraries and Information Systems 
Center, AT&T Bell Laboratories; Thomas Sullivan, former Associate Director of Index- 
ing Services, The H. W. Wilson Co.; and Elaine Svenonius, Professor, Graduate School 
of Library and Information Science, University of California at Los Angeles. 

Forest Press and the Forest Press Committee are assisted in their editorial responsibili- 
ties by an advisory group known as the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Commit- 
tee. The Editorial Policy Committee represents the libraries that use Dewey, and usually 
meets twice a year on matters relating to the development of the Classification. The 
Committee is made up of professionals who have experience in a wide variety of 
libraries, here and abroad, and who are well versed in the theory and application of the 
Classification. The members of the Committee who served during the preparation of Edi- 
tion 20 are listed in the Preface. 

For the actual editing of the Schedules, Tables, Index, and Manual, Forest Press con- 
tracts with the Library of Congress, whose table of organization includes a Decimal

Classification Division within its Processing Services Department. The Decimal 
Classification Division is the largest user of DDC in the world, applying DDC numbers to 
over 100,000 Library of Congress bibliographic records annually. In this way, 
classification theory and practice are combined, allowing for continuous and thorough 
editorial review. The editor of this edition has been John P. Comaromi, assisted by 
Julianne Beall, Winton E. Matthews, Jr., and Gregory R. New. 

The international acceptance of the Dewey Decimal Classification continues to grow. 
The British National Bibliography adopted Edition 18 in 1971, permitting British 
libraries and many others throughout the English-speaking world to apply Dewey 
numbers to their collections. The national bibliographies of Canada, India, Australia, 
Italy, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, and other countries also use Dewey 
numbers in their bibliographic publications. It is expected that other national bibliogra- 
phies will adopt Edition 20, thus enhancing the Classification and its application and 
benefiting the users of libraries everywhere by helping to standardize the subject 
approach to library materials. 

In June 1985, a change of administration at Forest Press took place, at which time the 
undersigned succeeded John A. Humphry as Executive Director. During John 
Humphry's eight-year tenure as Executive Director, the Press and all its publications 
enjoyed wide acclaim from the library community throughout the world, and interna- 
tional activities were greatly expanded.

Preface by the 
Decimal Classification 
Editorial Policy Committee 



The Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee was established in 1937 to 
serve as an advisory body in determining the general direction and policies of the Dewey 
Decimal Classification (DDC). It was reconstituted as a joint committee of the Lake 
Placid Education Foundation and the American Library Association in 1955. Its consti- 
tuency consists of libraries, information agencies, and users of the Classification in the 
United States and abroad. The current membership of the Committee consists of a 
diverse group of library and information professionals and is international in scope. Its 
membership of ten includes public, special, and academic librarians; library educators; 
representatives of the American Library Association, the Library of Congress, and Forest 
Press (publisher of the DDC); a representative of the (British) Library Association; and a 
Canadian library educator. The main function of the Committee is to work with the edi- 
tors of the DDC and advise Forest Press in matters relating to changes, innovations, and 
the general development of the Classification. 

Three separate publications issued between Editions 19 and 20 (004-006 Data 
Processing and Computer Science; 301-307 Sociology; and the Proposed Revision of 
780 Music) and other revisions and expansions in Dewey Decimal Classification, Addi- 
tions, Notes and Decisions (DC&) illustrate the policy of continuous revision adopted by 
the Editorial Policy and Forest Press Committees. Continuous revision means that major 
changes in the schedules and tables in most need of urgent development are issued 
between editions. These revisions are implemented at once on Library of Congress 
bibliographic records, making the new concepts and notations readily available for 
librarians to use. Librarians are thus able to implement the revised schedules and tables 
on an ongoing basis, instead of in more massive projects after the publication of new edi- 
tions. 

In creating new schedules and revising existing ones, the Committee often calls upon 
the expertise of outside groups. For Edition 20, such groups included various committees 
of the American Library Association, library associations of other countries, the African 
Section of the Library of Congress, working classifiers, and experts in various subjects 
(such as computer science and music). 

The completely revised 780 Music schedule, for example, took over ten years to 
develop and involved classification and music experts in the United States, United King- 
dom, Canada, and Australia, as well as a special subcommittee of the ALA Resources and 
Technical Services Division Subject Analysis Committee. The new music schedule is 
particularly needed as a tool for online browsing and retrieval in a complex subject area. 
The Editorial Policy Committee approved the changes in music for inclusion in Edition 
20 only after much deliberation. 

Since major revisions and expansions present inevitable implementation problems for 
libraries, they are recommended by the Committee only in response to requests of DDC 



xiu

users and where great need exists. For example, the new and greatly expanded schedules 
for 004-006 Data Processing and Computer Science and 301—307 Sociology were pub- 
lished between Editions 19 and 20 (and are now included in DDC 20) because the need 
for expansion to deal with the existing literature was identified by users and perceived by 
the DDC editors. 

In addition to the changes in the schedules, there is a complete revision of area — 711 
British Columbia and major expansions of areas — 52 Japan, — 669 Nigeria, — 68 South- 
ern Africa, and — 95 Papua New Guinea in Table 2. The changes and expansions in the 
area table were made only when the previous tables were unworkable (areas — 669, — 711 
and — 95) or when local literary warrant made expansion necessary (areas —52 and 
-68). 

Relocations proposed by the editors are carefully examined and weighed in terms of 
their implications for implementation. In the preparation of Edition 20, relocations were 
monitored: 1) to eliminate dual provisions; 2) to regularize the use of standard subdivi- 
sions; 3) to provide uniformity of development for parallel subjects; 4) to insure proper 
subject relationships; and 5) to rectify erroneous placement of subjects. Most relocations 
in Edition 20 fall into the first two categories. Many of the others are repercussions of the 
new schedule 004-006 Data Processing and Computer Science. Many numbers 
throughout the schedules relating to the field of computer technology were affected by the 
numbers in the new schedule. In determining which relocations were to be made, the 
extent of their effect on library service was always considered. 

With the prospect of the Dewey Decimal Classification serving as an online retrieval 
tool, the Committee also considered the implications of the DDC being used not only by 
classifiers, but also by library users. For example, in evaluating the terminology of the 
index, the Committee recommended that, wherever appropriate and feasible, proper 
names be indexed in AACR2 form, and entries from lists of subject headings be incor- 
porated into the index. As the Dewey Decimal Classification enters the online age, the 
Committee will continue to monitor future developments of the Classification and to 
recommend policies that will help it become more adaptable and amenable to online 
information storage and retrieval. 

Since the publication of Edition 19, many individuals have served on the Editorial Pol- 
icy Committee, each making unique contributions to its deliberations. Following is a list 
of the members (with the positions they held or hold during their tenure on the Commit- 
tee) who contributed to the preparation of Edition 20: Joanne S. Anderson, Coordinator of 
Reference Services, San Diego Public Library; Henriette D. Avram, Assistant Librarian 
for Processing Services, Library of Congress; Lizbeth J. Bishoff, formerly Principal 
Librarian for Support Services, Pasadena (California) Public Library, now Manager, 
Cataloging and Database Services, OCLC; Barbara Branson, Principal Cataloger, Perkins 
Library, Duke University; Lois Mai Chan, Professor, College of Library and Information 
Science, University of Kentucky; Margaret E. Cockshutt, Professor, Faculty of Library

to you this new edition of the Dewey Decimal Classification, with a sense of pride that 
this edition represents the best efforts of many individuals and the awareness that it is still 
far from perfect. The continuing development and viability of the Dewey Decimal 
Classification will rely on the interest and concern of all users around the world. Your 
comments, advice, and suggestions are ever welcome.

New Features in Edition 20 

The aim of Edition 20 is user convenience: clearer instructions, more explanations, 
greater accessibility through expanded summaries, elimination of duplicate provisions for 
classing single subjects, and the inclusion of a Manual to guide the classifier. 

Manual 

The most striking change in DDC 20 is the presence of a Manual to assist in its appli- 
cation. The Manual represents the core of a much larger body of notes first introduced in 
the separately published 1982 Manual on the Use of the Dewey Decimal Classification: 
Edition 19. The Manual describes policies and practices of the Decimal Classification 
Division of the Library of Congress, offers advice on classing in difficult areas, and 
explains how to choose between related numbers. The briefer notes of the 1982 Manual, 
and those that need to be used frequently, have been incorporated in the Schedules and 
Tables. The new notes and the Manual should help classifiers resolve problems and apply 
the DDC with greater consistency. 

General Format 

The number of summaries has been increased. Furthermore, a new type of summary 
that incorporates two levels of structure has been introduced to provide a more effective 
overview. An example of such a summary can be found at 370 Education. 

There is a significant increase in the number of notes in the Schedules and Tables, 
beyond the incorporation of notes from the 1982 Manual. There are more class-elsewhere 
notes to explain the relationship between overlapping and closely related subjects. A new 
kind of note, the see-also note, informs the classifier about related subjects that may be 
overlooked. Every add instruction includes at least one example. 

Option notes, now enclosed in parentheses, provide notation which may be used in 
place of the preferred standard notation. 

Completely revised segments and international cooperation 

The only completely revised schedule in Edition 20 is 780 Music, originally drafted in 
Great Britain by Russell Sweeney and John Clews. A detailed description of the changes 
in 780 is given under the heading of 780 in the Manual. Comparative and equivalence 
tables are found on pages 496-514 in this volume. 

The complete revision of the area table for British Columbia (T2 — 711) was drafted by 
a Canadian team headed by David Balatti of the National Library of Canada. 

The expansions of the area and history numbers for South Africa (T2— 68, 968) were 
developed in cooperation with the South African Institute of Library and Information Sci- 
ence; the African Section of the Library of Congress; and the American Library Associa- 
tion RTSD Committee on Cataloging: Asian and African Materials. 

Other instances of international assistance in the development of the DDC are the 
expansion and revision of the area table for Japan (T2 — 52) in cooperation with Genten 
Wakabayashi of the Private University Library Association of Japan, and the expansion

of the table for Melanesia (relocated from T2— 932-937 to T2— 95) and Papua New 
Guinea (T2— 953) in cooperation with Fraiser McConnell of the National Library Service 
of Papua New Guinea.

Table 3. Subdivisions for Individual Literatures, for Specific Literary Forms 

To render instructions less difficult to follow, Table 3 has been divided into three sub- 
tables: 

3-A for works by or about individual authors

Important Areas of Revision in the Schedules 

001-006 The span of numbers covering knowledge, systems, and data processing 
has been extensively revised. The relocation and expansion of data pro- 
cessing and computer science that appeared in the 1985 publication 
004—006 Data Processing and Computer Science and Changes in 
Related Disciplines have been incorporated in DDC 20 with some 
changes. The corresponding standard subdivision Tl — 0285 for com- 
puter application to a subject extends this expansion and revision 
throughout the Schedules. In addition, 003 Systems was expanded, and 
001.5 Cybernetics and related disciplines has been scattered as follows: 
interdisciplinary treatment of communication to 302.2, cybernetics to 
003.5, artificial intelligence to 006.3. 

207 Christian education and religious instruction relocated to 268 Religious 

education in order to distinguish Christianity as an academic subject 
(207) from instruction in Christianity as a way of life (268).

New Features 



529.7 Time systems relocated from 529.75 to 389.17 under Metrology and 
standardization, time instruments from 529.78 to 681.11 under Preci- 
sion instruments and other devices. 

530.4 States of matter expanded. 

604.6 Waste technology relocated to 628.4. 

621.38 Electronics and communications engineering substantially revised. 

621.38195 Computer engineering relocated to 621.39, and revised and expanded 
(published in 1985 004—006 Data Processing and Computer Science). 

628 Sanitary and environmental engineering significantly revised to elim- 

inate obsolete distinctions. 

720-724 Use of chronological periods for Oriental architecture and sculpture (the 
1 730-735 major topics relocated) has been made consistent with Western architec- 
ture and sculpture. 

738 Substantial revision of pottery and porcelain, especially with respect to 

brands, varieties, types, and products. 

780 Music has been completely revised. A Comparative table showing the 

location in both editions of most of the major topics of 780 is found on 
pages 496-504. An Equivalence table showing the changes in music 
from Edition 19 to Edition 20 and vice versa is found on pages 506-513. 
The new development is described in the 780 section of the Manual. 

782.1 Staging dramatic music (782 in Edition 19) relocated to 792.5-792.7 

and substantially revised. 

79 1 .4 Extensive revision of motion pictures, radio, television. 

794.8 Electronic and computer games revised and expanded. 

796.4 Weightlifting, track and field, gymnastics revised and expanded; athletic 

exercise relocated to 613.71 Physical fitness. 

797.17 Minor methods of navigation (e.g., surfing and water skiing) relocated 

to 797.3 Other aquatic sports (published in 1983/1984 in DC& 4:4). 

971.501-.504 Historical periods of New Brunswick moved to 971.5101-971.5104. 

972.8 Historical periods of Central America revised to reflect each country's 

history. 

Lists of relocations and reductions, and also comparative and equivalence tables are 
found on pages 479-514 in this volume. 

Relative Index 

The Relative Index for Edition 20 is smaller than the Index for Edition 19. The elimi- 
nation of many unlikely entries (such as mercury as a building material) and the removal 
of see references were the major factors in size reduction. 



xxi 1 1 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



See references have been eliminated from the Index since each term now has a number 
(in many cases this is the interdisciplinary number). See also references lead to broader 
and related terms. 

Proper names are indexed under their AACR2 form, and under other commonly used 
forms of the name. 

The seven Tables are identified by Tl, T2, T3, etc., e.g., the area number for the 
United States is T2— 73, Faust as a topic in literature T3C— 351.

Introduction 

to the 

Dewey Decimal Classification 

About the Introduction 

1.1 This Introduction is written primarily for the novice or beginning 
classifier, although the experienced classifier may benefit from review- 
ing its contents. 

1.2 The Introduction is meant to be used in conjunction with the Glossary 
(in this volume) and the Manual (in Volume 4). The Manual, which 
will be of interest to both beginners and experienced classifiers, con- 
tains additional and more detailed information about the use of the 
Classification, offers advice on classifying in difficult areas, and 
explains how to choose between related numbers. References to the 
Glossary appear throughout the Introduction. 

Classification: What It Is and What It Does 

2.1 Classification provides a system for organizing a universe of items, be 
they objects, concepts, or records. 

2.2 Notation is the system of symbols used to represent the classes in a 
classification system. In the Dewey Decimal Classification system 
(DDC), the notation is expressed in Arabic numerals. The notation 
gives at once both the unique meaning of the class and its relation to 
other classes. It permits the searcher to find a specific item within the 
class to which it belongs and near related classes. No matter how words 
describing subjects may differ, the notation identifies the subject and 
class within which the item belongs. 

2.3 Libraries usually arrange their collections according to the systematic 
structure of a library classification. Each item is assigned a call 
number (see Glossary), usually consisting of the notation for its class, 
accompanied by a book number or some other device to subarrange the 
items of a class. The call number provides a unique identifying code 
that is used as an "address" on the shelf, and as a tag for library record 
keeping in circulation and inventory control. 

2.4 The subject catalog is the index to the contents of a library collection. 
It lists works, parts of works, and important essays or literary works in 
collections by topic. If arranged alphabetically by words, it is called an 
alphabetical subject catalog (the pre-eminent form in North America). 
If arranged by the notation of a library classification system, it is called 



xxv 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



a classified catalog (the pre-eminent form in Europe). In addition to 
providing the class number at which the item is shelved, classified cata- 
logs provide numbers for other subjects in the work. 

History and Current Use of the Dewey Decimal Classification 

3.1 The Dewey Decimal Classification is the most widely used library 
classification system in the world. It is used in more than 135 countries, 
and has been translated into over 30 languages. In the United States, 
95% of all public and school libraries, 25% of all college and university 
libraries, and 20% of special libraries use the DDC. 

3.2 The DDC was conceived by Melvil Dewey in 1873 and first published 
in 1876. The first edition was 44 pages long: 14 pages of front and back 
matter, 12 pages of summaries and schedules, and 18 pages of index. 
In its 20th edition it has grown to a four-volume set. 

3.3 The DDC is developed, maintained, and applied in the Decimal 
Classification Division of the Library of Congress (LC), where annually 
over 100,000 DDC numbers are assigned to works acquired by the 
Library. In the United States, DDC numbers are incorporated into 
machine readable catalog (MARC) records, and distributed to libraries 
by way of computer tapes, Cataloging-in-Publication (CIP) data, and 
LC cards. DDC numbers also appear in MARC records in 12 other 
countries and are used in the national bibliographies of the United 
Kingdom, Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, 
Pakistan, Zimbabwe, and other countries. Various bibliographic utili- 
ties and services in the United States and elsewhere make DDC 
numbers available to libraries through online access, publications, and 
production of catalog cards. 

Overview of the Dewey Decimal Classification 

Conceptual Framework 

4.1 In the DDC, basic classes are organized by traditional academic disci- 
plines or fields of study. No principle is more basic to the DDC than 
this: the parts of the Classification are arranged by discipline, not by 
subject. 

4.2 The consequence of this principle is that there is likely to be no one sin- 
gle place for a given subject. Marriage, for example, has aspects which 
fall under several disciplines, such as music, philosophy, sociology, and 
law. Music for marriage ceremonies belongs in 781.587 as part of the 
discipline of music; ethical considerations in marriage in 173 as part of 
the discipline of philosophy; sociological studies of marriage in 306.81 
as part of the discipline of sociology; and legal aspects of marriage in

346.016 as part of the discipline of law. The Relative Index assembles 
the disciplinary aspects of a subject in one place:

Notation 

4.3 At the broadest level, the DDC is divided into ten main classes, which 

together cover the entire world of knowledge. These classes are further 
divided into ten divisions and each division into ten sections, although 
not all the numbers for the divisions and sections have been used. (The 



xxv 1 1 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



word "class" is used generally to indicate divisions, sections, and any 
other notational level in the hierarchy.) 

4.4 The ten main classes are: 

000 Generalities 

100 Philosophy, parapsychology and occultism, psychology 

200 Religion 

300 Social sciences 

400 Language 

500 Natural sciences and mathematics 

600 Technology (Applied sciences) 

700 The arts Fine and decorative arts 

800 Literature (Belles-lettres) and rhetoric 

900 Geography, history, and auxiliary disciplines 

4.5 Main class 000 is the most general class, and is used for works not lim- 
ited to any one specific discipline, such as encyclopedias, newspapers, 
and general periodicals. This class is also used for certain specialized 
disciplines that deal with knowledge and information generally, such as 
information science, library science, computer science, journalism, and 
bibliography. The content of the other nine classes is self-explanatory. 

4.6 The first digit in the numbers listed above indicates the main class. 
Although each number contains three digits, only the first digit is 
significant in this list. The remaining zeros fill out the notation to the 
required three digits. 

4.7 Each main class consists of ten divisions, also numbered through 9. 
The number of significant digits here is two, the second digit indicating 
the division. 600 is used for general works on the applied sciences, 610 
for the medical sciences, 620 for engineering, 630 for agriculture. 

4.8 Each division has ten sections, again numbered through 9. The third 
digit in each three-digit number indicates the section. Thus, 630 is used 
for general works on agriculture, 631 for specific techniques, 632 for 
plant injuries, 633 for field and plantation crops. 

4.9 A decimal point (see Glossary) follows the third digit, after which divi- 
sion by ten continues on down to as specific a degree of classification 
as may be desired. 

Principle of Hierarchy 

4.10 Hierarchy in the DDC is expressed through both notation and structure. 

4.11 Notational hierarchy is expressed by length of notation. As the follow- 
ing example shows, numbers at any given level are subordinate to a 



xxv in 



Introduction 



class whose notation is one digit shorter; coordinate with a class whose 
notation has the same number of significant digits; and superordinate to 
a class with numbers one or more digits longer. The underlined digits in 
the example below demonstrate this notational hierarchy: 

600 Technology (Applied sciences) 

630 Agriculture and related technologies 

636 Animal husbandry 

636.7 Dogs 

636.8 Cats 

4.12 "Dogs" and "Cats" are more specific than (or subordinate to) 
"Animal husbandry"; they are equally specific as (or coordinate with) 
each other; and "Animal husbandry" is less specific than (or superordi- 
nate to) "Dogs" and "Cats." 

4.13 Relationships among topics that violate notational hierarchy are indi- 
cated by notes and other devices. A centered entry often constitutes a 
major departure from notational hierarchy. A centered entry (so called 
because its numbers, heading, and notes appear in the center of the 
page) occurs when a span of numbers rather than a single number is 
used for a subject. In the DDC, centered entries are always flagged 
typographically by the symbol > in the number column. 

4.14 Structural hierarchy means that aside from the ten main classes every 
topic is subordinate to and part of all the broader topics above it. The 
corollary is also true: whatever is true of the whole is true of the parts. 
This important concept is sometimes called hierarchical force (see 
Glossary). Any note regarding the nature of a class holds true for all 
the subordinate classes (including logically subordinate topics classed 
at coordinate numbers). Because of this, such notes are given only 
once — at the highest level of application. For example, the scope note 
at 700 applies to 730, to 736, and to 736.4. The words "Description, 
critical appraisal ..." found in that scope note also govern 736.4 
Wood [carving], which thus includes the critical appraisal of wood 
carving. 

Classifying with the DDC 

Determining the Subject of a Work 

5.1 Classifying a work properly depends upon determining the subject of 

the work in hand. Judicious use of the following sources is suggested: 

(A) The title is sometimes a succinct abstract of the subject of a work, 
but it must always be regarded with suspicion; Zen and the Art of 
Motorcycle Maintenance does not sound like a work on values, 
but it is. 



xxix 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



(B) The table of contents, if genuinely descriptive, should display the 
main topics discussed. 

(C) Chapter headings may make up for the lack of a table of con- 
tents. Chapter subheadings often prove useful. 

(D) If an introduction (by someone other than the author) is provided, 
it should be perused. Such introductions are intended to assist the 
reader by indicating the subject of the work and suggesting the 
place of the work in the development of thought on the subject. 

(E) A preface (or introduction by the author) usually provides origi- 
nal purposes and afterthoughts. 

(F) A bibliography, bibliographic footnotes, and references are all 
valuable sources of information. 

(G) Cataloging copy from centralized cataloging services is often 
helpful by providing subject headings, classification numbers, 
and notes. Such copy appears on the verso of U.S. and British 
books as part of Cataloging-in-Publication (CIP) data. 

(H) The text of the work and book reviews can verify the conclusions 

reached by using the sources listed above. 
(I) Reference tools or knowledgeable people often help define terms. 

The steps above are necessary for works on technical, scientific, and 
historical matters; they are seldom necessary when classifying works of 
the imagination. In the DDC, works of the imagination are generally 
classified by literary form rather than by subject. 

Determining the Discipline for a Work 

5.2 The classifier must then select the proper discipline, or field of study, of 
the work. Because discipline is the primary consideration in classifying 
a work, works that are used together are found together. 

5.3 The guiding principle of the DDC is that a work is classed in the disci- 
pline for which it is intended, rather than the discipline from which the 
work derives. For example, a work by a zoologist on agricultural pest 
control should be classed in agriculture unless it concentrates on back- 
ground biological data, in which case it should be classed in biology. 

5.4 Once the subject has been determined, and information on the disci- 
pline has been found, the knowledgeable classifier will turn to the 
Schedules. The Summaries beginning on page ix of Volume 2 are a 
good means of mental navigation for beginners. The Relative Index 
may help by suggesting the disciplines in which a subject is normally 
treated (for a discussion of the Relative Index, see paragraphs 
10.1-10.15). 

5.5 Whether or not the Relative Index is used, the classifier must rely on 
the structure of the Classification, and various aids throughout, to arrive 



xxx 



Introduction 



at the proper place to classify a work. Even the most promising Rela- 
tive Index citations must be verified in the Schedules; the Schedules are 
the only place where all the information about coverage and use of the 
numbers may be found. 

More Than One Subject 

5.6 When two or more subjects are treated in a work, use the following 
guidelines: 

(A) Class a work dealing with interrelated subjects with the subject 
that is being acted upon. This is called the "rule of application," 
and takes precedence over any other rule. For instance, class an 
analytical work dealing with Shakespeare's influence on Keats 
with Keats. 

(B) Class a work on two subjects with the subject receiving fuller 
treatment. 

(C) If two subjects receive equal treatment, and are not used to intro- 
duce or explain one another, class the work with the subject 
whose number comes first in the DDC Schedules. This is called 
the "first-of-two rule." For example, a history dealing equally 
with the United States and Japan, in which the United States is 
discussed first and is given first in the title, is classed with the his- 
tory of Japan because 952 precedes 973. 

Occasionally, specific instructions are given to use numbers 
which do not come first in the Schedules, e.g., to class birds (598) 
and mammals (599) in 599, which is the comprehensive number 
for warm-blooded vertebrates. Also disregard the "first-of-two 
rule" when the two topics are the two major subdivisions of a 
subject. For example, water supply (628.1) and waste control 
(628.4) taken together constitute most of 628 Sanitary engineer- 
ing; works on these topics are classed in 628 (not 628.1). 

(D) Class a work on three or more subjects that are all subdivisions of 
a broader subject in the first higher number that includes them all 
(unless one subject is treated more fully than the others). This is 
called the "rule of three." For example, a history of Portugal 
(946.9), Sweden (948.5), and Greece (949.5) is classed with the 
history of Europe (940). 

More Than One Discipline 

5.7 Treating a subject from the point of view of more than one discipline is 
different from treating several subjects in one discipline. Use the 
guidelines in paragraphs 5.8-5.1 1. 



xxxi 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



5.8 Use the interdisciplinary number provided in the Schedules or Relative 
Index if one is given. An important consideration in using such an 
interdisciplinary number is that the work must contain significant 
material on the discipline in which the interdisciplinary number is 
found. For example, 305.231 (a sociology number) is provided for 
interdisciplinary works on child development. However, if a work that 
is interdisciplinary with respect to child development gives little 
emphasis to social development and a great deal of emphasis to the 
psychological and physical development of the child (155.4 and 612.65, 
respectively), class it in 155.4 (the first number in the Schedules of the 
next two obvious choices). In short, interdisciplinary numbers are not 
absolute; they are to be used only when applicable. 

5.9 Class works not given an interdisciplinary number in the discipline that 
gives the subject fullest treatment. For example, a work dealing with 
both the scientific and the engineering principles of electrodynamics is 
classed in 537.6 if the engineering aspects are introduced primarily for 
illustrative purposes, but in 621.31 if the basic scientific theories are 
only preliminary to the author's exposition of engineering principles 
and practices. 

5.10 When classifying interdisciplinary works, do not overlook the possibili- 
ties of main class 000 Generalities, e.g., 080 for a collection of inter- 
views of famous people from various disciplines. 

5.11 Any other situation is treated in the same fashion as those found above 
in the instructions at More Than One Subject (paragraph 5.6). 

When All Else Fails 

5.12 When several numbers have been found for the work in hand, and each 
seems as good as the next, the following considerations may prove 
useful: 

5.13 Rule of Zero. Subdivisions beginning with zero should be avoided if 
there is a choice between and 1 -9 at the same point in the hierarchy of 
the notation. Similarly, subdivisions beginning with 00 should be 
avoided when there is a choice between 00 and 0. For example, a biog- 
raphy of an American Methodist missionary in China is classed in 266 
Missions. The content of the work can be expressed in three different 
numbers: 

266.0092 biography of a missionary 

266.0237305 1 foreign missions of the United States in China 

266.76092 biography of a United Methodist Church missionary 

The last number is used since it has no zero at the fourth position. 



xxxi i 



Introduction 



5.14 Table of last resort. In the absence of any other rule, the following 

table (in order of preference) may be used with caution: 

(1) Kinds of things 

(2) Parts of things 

(3) Materials from which things, kinds, or parts are made 

(4) Properties of things, kinds, parts, or materials 

(5) Processes within things, kinds, parts, or materials 

(6) Operations upon things, kinds, parts, or materials 

(7) Instrumentalities for performing such operations 

For example, surveillance by border patrols could be classed in either 
363.285 Border patrols, or 363.232 Patrol and surveillance. Choose 
363.285 since border patrols are a kind of police service, while patrol 
and surveillance are processes performed by police services. However, 
do not apply this table (or any other guidelines, for that matter) if it 
appears to flout the author's intention and emphasis. 

How DDC 20 Is Arranged 

6.1 DDC 20 is composed of six major parts in four volumes as follows: 

Volume 1 

(A) Introduction: Introduces the user to the DDC and provides 
instructions on how to use it. 

(B) Tables: The seven numbered Tables provide notation that can be 
added to the class numbers in the Schedules to provide greater 
subject specificity. 

(C) Lists which compare Editions 19 and 20: Relocations and reduc- 
tions; Comparative Tables for Music and British Columbia; 
Equivalence Tables for Music and British Columbia. 

Volumes 2 and 3 

(D) Schedules: Knowledge organized from 001 to 999. 

Volume 4 

(E) Relative Index: An alphabetical list of subjects found in the 
Schedules and Tables, including synonyms and selected terms in 
common use. 

(F) Manual: Provides advice for classifying in difficult areas, and 
describes policies and practices followed by the Decimal 
Classification Division at the Library of Congress. Information 
in the Manual is arranged by the numbers in the Schedules and 
Tables. 

Key Features of the Schedules and Tables 

Summaries 

7.1 Summaries provide an overview of the intellectual and notational struc- 

ture of classes. Three types of summaries appear in the Schedules and 
Tables of the DDC: 

xxxiii 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



(A) The summaries of the Schedules as a whole are found at the front 
of the Schedules (Volume 2). 

(B) Single-level summaries in the Schedules and Tables provide an 
overview of classes (except main classes) that have subdivisions 
extending over more than two pages. For example, 649 Child 
rearing and home care of the sick and infirm has the following 
summary: 

SUMMARY 



Entries 



649.1 
.3 
.4 

.5 


Child rearing 

Feeding 

Clothing and health 

Activities and recreation 


.6 

.7 
.8 


Training 

Moral and character training 

Home care of sick and infirm 



(C) Multi-level summaries are provided for eight major divisions and 
the Area Tables for Europe and North America. See 370 Educa- 
tion for an example of a multi-level summary. 



7.2 Schedule and Table entries are composed of a DDC number in the 
number column (the column at the left margin), a heading describing 
the class that the number represents, and often one or more notes. 

7.3 The first three digits of Schedule numbers (main classes, divisions, sec- 
tions) appear only once in the number column (when first used). They 
are repeated at the top of each page where their subdivisions continue. 
Subordinate numbers (beginning with a decimal point) appear in the 
number column, with the initial three digits understood. For example: 

37 1 School organization and management; special education 

Class here schools and school systems, school policy 

Class government regulation, control, support of educa- 
tion in 379; schools of specific levels in 372-374, 378 

.5 School discipline 

Overseeing student conduct 

For classroom discipline, see 371.1024 

See also 371.782 for school programs to reduce 
violence 
.59 Student participation in the maintenance of discipline 

Examples: monitorial and prefectorial systems, 
honor systems, student government

Introduction 



1A Table numbers are given in full in the number column of the Tables, 

and are never used alone. They may be used only when appended or 
added to numbers from the Schedules. There are seven numbered 
Tables in DDC 20, as follows: 

Tl Standard Subdivisions 

T2 Geographic Areas, Historical Periods, Persons 

T3 Subdivisions for Individual Literatures, for Specific

Except for notation from Table 1 (which may be added to any number 
unless there is an instruction in the Schedules to the contrary), Table 
notations may be added only as instructed in the Schedules (for a 
detailed discussion of the use of the seven Tables, see paragraphs 
8.3-8.14). 

7.5 When a subordinate topic is a major part of a number, it is sometimes 
given as a part of the heading. For example: 

— 72 Middle America Mexico 
610 Medical sciences Medicine 

7.6 Some numbers in the Schedules and Tables are in brackets or 
parentheses. Numbers in brackets ([ ]) represent topics which have 
been relocated elsewhere or are unassigned. Bracketed numbers should 
never be used. Numbers and notes in parentheses provide options to 
standard practice (for a discussion of options, see paragraphs 
11.1-11.4). 

Notes 

7.7 Notes are important because they supply information that is not obvi- 
ous in the notational hierarchy or in the heading with regard to order, 
structure, subordination, and other matters. The notes described below 
(A) define what is found in the class and its subdivisions; (B) identify 
topics in "standing room," i.e., topics with insufficient literature to 
have their own number; (C) describe what is found in other classes; and 
(D) explain changes in the Schedules and Tables. Other notes are 
described in the sections on number building (paragraphs 8.1-8.17), 
precedence and citation order (paragraphs 9.1-9.5), and options (para- 
graphs 11.1-11.4).

7.8 Notes in categories (A) and (C) have hierarchical force (i.e., are appli- 
cable to all the subdivisions of a particular number). Those in category 
(B) do not have hierarchical force except where noted. 

(A) Notes That Describe What Is Found in a Class 

7.9 Definition and scope notes indicate the meaning and scope of the class. 
For example: 

004.7 Peripherals 

Input, output, storage devices that work with a computer 
but are not part of its central processing unit or internal 
storage 

7.10 Former heading notes are given only when a heading has been altered 
to such a degree that the new heading bears little or no resemblance to 
the old. There is usually no change in the meaning of the number. For 
example: 

597.51 *Elopomorpha 

Former heading: Apodes (Morays and true eels) 

7.11 Variant name notes are used for synonyms or near synonyms. For 
example: 

332.32 Savings and loan associations 

Variant names: building and loan associations, home 
loan associations, mortgage institutions 

7.12 General aspects notes enumerate aspects that are not found in the stan- 
dard subdivisions of Table 1 but are applicable to all the subdivisions 
of a particular number. For example: 

690 Buildings 

General aspects: planning, analysis, engineering design, 
construction, destruction of habitable structures and their 
utilities 

7.13 Class-here notes list major topics that are included in a class even 
though they may be broader or narrower than the heading, overlap it, or 
define another way of looking at essentially the same material. For 
example: 

363.7 Environmental problems and services 

Class here environmental protection 

Environmental protection overlaps 363.7 and is a large part of it. For 
instance, 363.728 Waste disposal is a service very important in environ- 
mental protection.

Introduction 



7.14 Class-here notes are also used to indicate where interdisciplinary and 
comprehensive works are classed. In the DDC, "interdisciplinary 
works" treat a subject from the perspective of more than one discipline. 
"Comprehensive works" treat a subject from various points of view 
within a single discipline. For example: 

391 Costume and personal appearance 

Class here interdisciplinary works on costume, clothing, 
fashion 

025.213 Censorship 

Class here comprehensive works on library policies and 
practices relating to intellectual freedom 

(B) Notes That Identify Topics in Standing Room 

7.15 Standing room notes identify topics that have "standing room" in the 
number where the note is found. Standing room numbers provide a 
location for topics with relatively few works written about them, but 
whose literature may grow in the future, at which time they may be 
assigned their own number. These notes are introduced by one of the 
following terms: "Including," "Contains," "Example(s)," and 
"Common names." Standard subdivisions cannot be added to topics 
in standing room, nor are other number-building techniques allowed. 

7.16 Including notes list topics that are not obviously a part of the number. 
For example: 

940.44 Air operations [of World War I] 

Including antiaircraft defenses 

Antiaircraft defenses are not strictly part of aerial operations, but it is 
logical to class them in the same number. Class 940.44 has eight subdi- 
visions, one of which is 940.444 Events of 1914. However, the includ- 
ing note signals that works on antiaircraft defenses of 1914 are to be 
classed in 940.44, not 940.444. 

7.17 Contains notes list all of the major components of the number that do 
not have their own subdivisions. For example: 

583.976 Fagales 

Contains Fagaceae (oak family), Betulaceae (birch 
family), Corylaceae 

—4955 Ionian islands 

Contains Cephalonia, Corfu, Leukas, Zante nomes 
(provinces)

Dewey Decimal Classification 



7.18 Example notes describe the contents of an abstract category when the 
specific contents may not be immediately apparent. For example: 

623.829 Hand-propelled and towed craft 

Examples: barges, canoes, coracles, lifeboats, rafts, 
rowboats, scows, towed canalboats 

7.19 Common name notes are used only in biology. They list common 
English terms that are typical examples of the more carefully defined 
Latin taxonomic categories. 

595.7644 *Cantharoidea 

Common names: fireflies, glowworms, soldier beetle 

When the English term covers most members of the taxonomic 
category, the instructions have hierarchical force. 

(C) Notes on What Is Found in Other Classes 

7.20 Class-elsewhere notes indicate where to class parts of a subject or 
topics related to it, if they do not class in subdivisions of the number at 
hand. All notes that begin with the word "class" are class-elsewhere 
notes, except when they begin with "class here." 

34 1 .73 Peace and disarmament 

Class peaceful settlement of disputes in 341.52 

343.0944 Vehicles 

Class property laws relating to vehicles in 346.047, 
vehicle operation in 343.0946, vehicle product liabil- 
ity in 346.038, vehicle insurance in 346.086092, . . . 

028.1 Reviews 

Class reviews of computer programs in 005.30296; 
techniques of reviewing in 808.066028; reviews of 
works on a specific subject or in a specific discipline 
with the subject or discipline, e.g., reviews of works 
on chemistry 540, reviews of entertainment films 
791.43, critical appraisal of literature 800 

7.21 See references begin with the word "For." A see reference in the DDC 
signifies that the subject referred to is a part of the class from which the 
reference is made. For example: 

— 4 1 1 5 Highland Region 

Class here *Scottish Highlands 

For districts of Highland Region, see — 41 16-41 19

Introduction 



7.22 See-also references refer to subjects tangentially related to the class in 
hand. They are reminders that minor differences in wording and con- 
text often imply major differences in classification. For example: 

641.22 Wine 

Class here grape wine 

See also 641.23 for sake (rice wine) 

(D) Notes Explaining Changes in the Schedules and Tables 

7.23 Revision notes warn users that there have been changes in the subdivi- 
sions of a class since the previous edition. They range from a note 
explaining that there has been a complete revision (as with 780 Music) 
to a note explaining that a few minor boundary changes in the 1973 
reorganization of Chile are not spelled out in subdivisions of notation 
83 in Table 2. The revision note is always the first note under the head- 
ing of the class affected. 

7.24 Discontinued notes indicate that a number from an earlier edition is no 
longer used, or that some part of the subject of a number has been 
moved to a shorter number. For example: 

523 Specific celestial bodies and phenomena 

Use of this number for comprehensive works on descrip- 
tive astronomy discontinued; class in 520 

7.25 Relocation notes state that all or part of the contents of a number have 
been moved to a different number. For example: 

362.293 Narcotics 

Cocaine relocated to 362.298 

362.71 Direct relief 

Protection for abused and neglected children relo- 
cated to 362.768 

The relocation note is usually restated at the new number, either in the 
heading or in the appropriate note: 

362.298 Cocaine {formerly 362.293] 

362.768 Remedial measures, services, forms of assistance 

Including protection for abused and neglected chil- 



dren [formerly 362.71]

Dewey Decimal Classification 



Number Building 

8.1 The classifier will sometimes find that to arrive at a precise number for 
a work it is necessary to build or synthesize a number that is not 
specifically printed in the Schedules. Such built numbers allow for 
greater depth of content analysis. They are used only when instructions 
in the Schedules make them possible (except for standard subdivisions 
which are discussed in paragraphs 8.3-8.4). Building numbers begins 
with a base number (always stated in the instruction note) to which 
another number is added. 

8.2 Basically there are four ways to build numbers: (A) from standard sub- 
divisions (Table 1); (B) from the other Tables (Tables 2-7); (C) from 
other parts of the Schedules; and (D) from add tables in the Schedules. 

(A) Adding Standard Subdivisions from Table 1 

8.3 Notation from Table 1 Standard Subdivisions may be added to any 
number in the Schedules unless there is a specific instruction to the con- 
trary. A standard subdivision represents a recurring physical form 
(such as a dictionary, periodical, or index) or approach (such as history 
or research) and thus is applicable to any subject or discipline. Here are 
a few examples: 

150.5 Periodical on psychology 

203 Dictionary of Christianity 

340.02573 Directory of American lawyers 

507.8 Use of apparatus and equipment in the study and 

teaching of science, e.g., science fair projects 

622.0285 Use of computers in mining 

808.04205 Periodical on writing English 

The number of zeros is always indicated in the Schedules; the classifier 
should never use more than one zero in applying a standard subdivision 
unless instructed to do so. 

8.4 The most important caveat with respect to standard subdivisions is that 
in most cases they are added only for works that cover or approximate 
the whole of the subject of the number. For example, a work on black 
widow spiders of California should be classed in the number for spiders 
595.44 (not 595.4409794, the number for spiders in California). The 
classifer should not attempt to specify California because black widow 
spiders do not approximate the whole universe of spiders in California. 
Further instructions on using Table 1 are found at the beginning of 
Table 1 and in the Table 1 section of the Manual.

Introduction 



(B) Adding from Tables 2-7 

8.5 The classifier may be instructed to add a number from Tables 2-7 to a 
base number from the Schedules or to a number from a Table. A sum- 
mary of the use of each Table follows. 

8.6 Table 2 Geographic Areas, Historical Periods, Persons. Table 2 
numbers are added through the use of one of several standard subdivi- 
sions from Table 1 (09, 025, 071, etc.), e.g., reading in the elementary 
schools of Australia is 372.40994 (372.4 reading in elementary schools 
+ 09 Historical, geographical, persons treatment from Table 1 + 94 
Australia from Table 2). 

$.7 Area numbers are sometimes added directly to schedule numbers, but 

only when specified in a note. For example: 

373.3-373.9 Secondary education and schools by specific con- 
tinents, countries, localities 

Add to base number 373 notation 3-9 from 
Table 2, e.g., secondary schools of Australia 
373.94 

8.8 Table 3 Subdivisions for Individual Literatures, for Specific Literary 
Forms. These subdivisions are used only in class 800 as instructed, usu- 
ally following numbers for specific languages in 810-890 (see the 
Table 3 section in the Manual). 

8.9 Table 4 Subdivisions of Individual Languages. These subdivisions are 
used only in class 400 as instructed, following numbers for specific 
languages in 420-490 (see the Table 4 section in the Manual). 

8.10 Table 5 Racial, Ethnic, National Groups. Table 5 numbers are added 
through the use of standard subdivision 089 from Table 1, e.g., Ceramic 
arts of Chinese artists the world over is 738.089951 (738 Ceramic arts 
+ 089 [Racial, ethnic, national groups] + 951 Chinese from Table 5). 

8.11 Numbers from Table 5 may also be added directly to schedule numbers, 
but only when specified in a note. For example: 

155.84 Specific racial and ethnic groups 

Add to base number 155.84 notation 03-99 from 
Table 5, e.g., ethnopsychology of Afro- Americans 
155.8496073 

8.12 Table 6 Languages. The most important uses of these numbers are to 
provide the basis for building a specific language number in 490 (to 
which notation from Table 4 is sometimes added) and to provide the 
basis for building a specific literature number in 890 (to which notation 
from Table 3 is sometimes added). The numbers are also used in 
Table 2 under — 175 Regions where specific languages predominate, 
and at various points in the Schedules. 

xli 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



8.13 Table 7 Groups of Persons. The most important use of these numbers 
is through the use of standard subdivision 024 from Table 1 (which 
indicates treatment of a specific subject for specific kinds of users). 
For example: 

513.024694 Arithmetic for carpenters (513 Arithmetic + 024 

Works for specific types of users from Table 1 + 
694 carpenters from Table 7). 

8.14 Another use involves the sociology of occupational groups. A note 
specifies that the numbers from Table 7 are added directly to the 
schedule number: 

305.909- .999 Persons by occupation 

Add to base number 305.9 notation 09-99 
from Table 7, e.g., persons occupied with reli- 
gion 305.92, postal workers 305.9383 

The group of persons found in Table 7 may also be shown through the 
use of standard subdivision 088 (Specific occupational and religious 
groups), e.g., farmers in United States history 973.088631 (973 United 
States history + 088 with respect to occupational and religious groups + 
631 farmers). 

(C) Adding from Other Parts of the Schedules 

8.15 There are many instructions to make a direct addition to a number from 
another part of the Schedules. For example: 

809.935 [Literature] Emphasizing subjects 

Add to base number 809.935 notation 001-999, e.g., 
religious works as literature 809.9352, biography and 
autobiography as literature 809.93592 

In this example, the 2 in 809.9352 comes from 200 Religion, the 92 in 
809.93592 from 920 Biography, genealogy, insignia. 

8.16 In many cases, part of a number may be added to another number upon 
instruction. For example: 

373.01 1 Secondary education for specific objectives 

Add to base number 373.011 the numbers following 
370.11 in 370.112-370.118, e.g., education for social 
responsibility 373.0115 

In this example, 5 comes from 370.115 Education for social responsi- 
bility. Sometimes numbers are taken from more than one place in the 
Schedules; in such cases the procedure for the second addition is the 
same as for the first. 



xlii 



Introduction 



(D) Adding from Tables Found in the Schedules 

8.17 Add tables in the Schedules provide numbers to be added to designated 

Schedule numbers (identified by a footnote); these tables must be used 
only as instructed. For instance, the add table at 616.1-616.9 is used 
only for diseases tagged with an asterisk or in class-here notes under 
headings tagged with an asterisk. Notation from the add table, such as 
061 Drug therapy, may be used for 616.521 Eczema (asterisked) but not 
for hives (found in an including note at 616.51 but not asterisked). 

Number Building: Citation and Precedence Order 

9.1 Precedence and citation order come into play when multiple aspects or 
characteristics of a subject (such as age, area, gender, historical periods, 
national origin) are provided for in the Classification, and a single work 
treats more than one of them. 

Citation Order 

9.2 Citation order allows the classifier to build or synthesize a number 
using two or more aspects or characteristics as specified in instruction 
notes. Success in building a DDC number requires determining which 
characteristics apply to a specific work, and determining from the DDC 
the sequence in which the characteristics will be ordered. 

9.3 Citation order is always carefully detailed in number-building instruc- 
tions. For example: 

330.91-. 99 Geographical treatment (Economic geography) 

Add to base number 330.9 notation 1-9 from Table 
2, e.g., economic situation and conditions in France 
330.944; then add (except 00 for North and South 
America) and to the result add historical period 
numbers from appropriate subdivisions of 
930-990, e.g., economic situation and conditions in 
France under Louis XIV 330.944033, in the United 
States during Reconstruction period 330.97308, in 
South America in 20th century 330.98003 

The number-building instruction defines the limits of number building; 
in the above example the classifier can build no further than historical 
period because the instruction does not permit it. 

Precedence Order 

9.4 If there is no provision to show more than one of the aspects or charac- 
teristics, it is a matter of precedence (because one choice must be made 



xliii 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



among several characteristics). Precedence notes supply either an 
instruction or table establishing precedence. An example of a prece- 
dence instruction is found at 305.9: 

305.9 Occupational and miscellaneous groups 

Unless otherwise instructed, class complex subjects with 
aspects in two or more subdivisions of 305.9 in the 
number coming last, e.g., unemployed bibliographers 
305.9091 (not 305.90694) 

In this case, the base subject is a group of persons; the two characteris- 
tics are employment status and occupational status. The occupation of 
bibliographer (305.9091) comes after unemployed status (305.90694) 
in the classification hierarchy; following the instruction note, therefore, 
the characteristic which must be chosen is bibliographer (305.9091). 

9.5 An example of a table indicating precedence order is found at 800: 

800 Literature (Belles-lettres) and rhetoric 

Unless other instructions are given, observe the follow- 
ing table of precedence, e.g., collections of drama writ- 
ten in poetry from more than one literature 808.82 (not 
808.81) 

Drama 

Poetry 

Fiction 

Essays 

Speeches 

Letters 

Miscellaneous writings 

Satire and humor 

This list means that fiction written as poetry is classed in poetry, but 
humorous fiction is classed in fiction. 

The Relative Index 

10.1 The Relative Index is so called because it relates subjects to disciplines. 

In the Schedules, subjects are distributed among disciplines; in the 
Relative Index subjects are arranged alphabetically, with terms identify- 
ing the disciplines in which they are treated subarranged alphabetically 
under them. For example: 

Hospitals 362.11 

accounting 657.832 2 

animal husbandry 636.083 2 

architecture 725.51 

armed forces 355.72

Hospitals (continued) 

Civil War (United States) 973.776 

landscape architecture 7 1 2.7 

liability law 346.031 

Mexican war 973.627 5 

social theology 291.178 321 1

War of 1812 973.527 5 

World War I 940.476 

World War II 940.547 6 

In some cases the term implies rather than states the discipline. In the 
above listing, "armed forces" implies the discipline of military sci- 
ence, "Vietnamese War" the discipline of history. 

How to Use the Relative Index 

10.2 Once the subject of the work in hand is determined and located in the 
Relative Index, the classifier may find it helpful to review the disci- 
plines and DDC numbers listed in the Index under the subject term. In 
all cases, however, the discipline and number must be checked in the 
Schedules or Tables, where complete information about the number and 
what it includes can be found. 

10.3 The Relative Index is primarily an index to the terminology of the 
DDC. If the term sought is not found, the classifier should try a broader 
term, e.g., Agricultural industries if Livestock industry is not found. 

Format and Arrangement of the Relative Index 

10.4 Index entries are arranged alphabetically word by word, e.g., Birth 
order precedes Birthday, New York precedes Newark. Terms indented 
below the main headings are alphabetized in one group even though 
they may be a mixture of disciplines, topical subheadings, and words 
that, when combined with the main heading, form phrases or inverted 
phrases. Terms qualified by words in parentheses file following words 
that are not so qualified, e.g., Air transportation insurance (Inland 
marine) files after Air transportation insurance. 

10.5 Class numbers are printed in groups of three for ease of reading and 
copying. The spaces are not part of the numbers and do not represent 
convenient places to abridge the number. 



xlv 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



10.6 Both direct and indirect entries are used in the Index. For example: 

Adult education 
Cemeteries 

World War II 
Programs 

television broadcasting 

10.7 See-also references are used for synonyms, for references to broader 
terms (but only when three or more new numbers will be found at the 
broad term), and for references to related terms (which may provide 
only one or two new numbers). 

10.8 Numbers drawn from Tables 1-7 are indicated by Tl through T7: 

Tl Standard Subdivisions 

T2 Geographic Areas, Historical Periods, Persons 
T3 Subdivisions for Individual Literatures, for Specific Literary 
Forms (for use in 800) 
T3- A Subdivisions for Works by or about Individual Authors 
T3-B Subdivisions for Works by or about More than One 

Author 
T3-C Notation to Be Added Where Instructed in Table 3-B 
and in 808-809 
T4 Subdivisions of Individual Languages (for use in 400) 
T5 Racial, Ethnic, National Groups 
T6 Languages 
T7 Groups of Persons 

Order in Which Numbers Are Displayed 

10.9 The first class number displayed in an Index entry (the unindented 
term) is the number for interdisciplinary works. If the term also 
appears in the Tables, the Table numbers are listed next, followed by 
other aspects of the term. For example: 



Young adults 




305.235

-083 5 




T7- 


-055 


etiquette 




395.123

649.125 


Interdisciplinary Numbers 







10.10 Interdisciplinary numbers are not provided in the Index in the following 

three instances: 
(1) When the unindented term is ambiguous, e.g.: 

Liquid phases 

liquid-state physics 530.424 

xlvi 



Introduction 



(2) When the unindented term has no disciplinary focus, e.g.: 

Collecting T 1—075 

biological specimens 579.6 

descriptive research 00 1 .433 

museology 069.4 

recreation 790.132 

(3) When the interdisciplinary number might be misleading, e.g.: 

Poodle 

animal husbandry 636.72 

see also Dogs 

Only the animal husbandry number for poodles is given in the 
Index because the literature does not warrant an interdisciplinary 
number for poodles in zoology. 

For more information on interdisciplinary numbers, see paragraphs 

5.8-5.12. 

Terms Included in the Relative Index 

10.11 The Relative Index contains terms found in the headings and notes of 
the Schedules and Tables, synonyms, and selected terms in common 
use. 

10.12 The following types of names from Table 2 Geographic Areas are 
included in the Index: (A) names of countries; (B) names of the states 
and provinces of most countries; (C) names of the counties of the 
United States; (D) names of capital cities and other important munici- 
palities; and (E) names of certain important geographic features. 

10.13 Also included in the Relative Index are the following groups of per- 
sons: heads of state used to identify historical periods, e.g., Louis XIV; 
founders of religions, e.g., Muhammad; initiators of schools of thought, 
e.g., Adam Smith. 

10.14 Place names and other proper names are generally given in the form 
specified by the second edition of the Anglo-American Cataloguing 
Rules (AACR2), based on the names established in the Library of 
Congress authority files. Where an established form of the name was 
not available, an AACR2 form was provided by the editors. Diacritics 
have been provided only for the following languages: Amharic, 
Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, 
Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Urdu.

Terms Not Included in the Relative Index 

10.15 Terms usually not included in the Index are: 

(A) Phrases (mostly in the arts) beginning with the adjective form 
languages and countries, e.g., American short stories, Frenc 
cooking, Italian architecture 

(B) Phrases which contain general concepts represented by standai 
subdivisions such as education, statistics, laboratories, ai 
management, e.g., Art education, Educational statistics, Medicz 
laboratories, and Bank management. 

Options 

11.1 The recommended standard notation for English-language users of thi 
DDC is provided in this Edition. At a number of places in thJ 
Schedules, options are provided for libraries whose needs are not me| 
by the standard provisions. 

11.2 Options are found in parentheses and, when they apply to a specific 
note, are indented under the note. International users find options par-] 
ticularly helpful. Some important options for these users include insert- 
ing letters in the notation or using briefer notation to give prominenc< 
to the religion, literature, and language of a particular country. Exam- 
ples of inserting letters and using briefer notation are found at 292-299| 
Religions other than Christianity, as follows: 

(Options: To give preferred treatment or shorter numbers to a| 
specific religion, use one of the following: 

(Option A: Class the religion in 230-280, its sources in 220, 
comprehensive works in 200; in that case class the Bible and Chris- 
tianity in 298) 

(Option E: Place first by use of a letter or other symbol, e.g., Hin- 
duism 2HO (preceding 220), or 29H (preceding 291 or 292); add to 
the base number thus derived, e.g., to 2H or to 29H, the numbers fol- 
lowing the base number for the religion in 292-299, e.g., Shivaism 
2H5.13or29H.513) 

11.3 While options are printed in the DDC, they are not used in the central- 
ized classification service supplied by the Library of Congress (except 
for a second number in law 340 and for biography), and are only occa- 
sionally supplied by other centralized services. 

11.4 Alphabetical-arrangement and chronological-arrangement notes are 
not placed in parentheses, but are, in effect, options. They represent 
suggestions only; the material need not be arranged alphabetically or 
chronologically. An example of an alphabetical arrangement note is 
found at 005.133 Specific programming languages: Arrange alphabeti- 
cally by name of programming language, e.g., COBOL.

Introduction 



Close and Broad Classification 

12.1 One of the valuable features of the DDC notation is its adaptability to 
both close and broad classification. Close classification means that the 
content of a work is specified by notation to the fullest extent possible. 
Broad classification means that the notation places the work only in a 
broad class by the use of shorter notation. For instance, a work on 
French cooking is classed closely at 641.5944 (641.59 Cooking by 
place + 44 France from Table 2), broadly at 641.5 (cooking). Close 
classification is recommended for classes in which many works are 
found. How close or how broad the classification of a specific library 
should be depends on the size and diversity of the collection. 

12.2 The classifier should reduce the number to produce a grouping useful to 
the patrons of the library. For instance, a work on the family behavior 
of siblings in Canadian society would be most usefully classed in 
306.8750971 (the full number) in a research library with a large sociol- 
ogy collection, in 306.875 (sibling relationships) in a large public 
library, in 306.87 (intrafamily relationships) in a high school library. 
One aid to reducing DDC numbers is the segmentation device provided 
by the Decimal Classification Division of the Library of Congress and 
some other centralized cataloging services. A more detailed description 
of this device is provided in the Appendix to the Manual in Volume 4. 

12.3 The classifier should never reduce the notation to less than the most 
specific three-digit number (no matter how small the library's collec- 
tion). A number also must never be reduced so that it ends in a any- 
where to the right of the decimal point. 

12.4 The abridged edition supplies reduction on a ready-made basis and is 
convenient for small libraries to use on that account. Abridged Edition 
12 is intended for school libraries and for public libraries with 
moderately developed collections. The editors have been guided in 
length of abridged edition numbers and inclusion of topics by the 
advice of a subcommittee of the Subject Analysis Committee of the 
American Library Association. 

Book Numbers 

13.1 Most libraries find that some sort of subarrangement of the classes of 
the DDC is necessary for the efficient shelving and retrieval of specific 
works. 

13.2 A common filing device for small libraries is to give the first three 
letters of the main entry (usually the author) on the spine. For example: 

937 Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire 
Gib 

Such libraries also often class all biography in a "B" collection, and all 
xlix 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



fiction in an "F" collection, still using three-letter book numbers for 
the subject and author, respectively. In the latter case a single letter may 
indicate a title by an author. For example: 

B A biography of Lincoln 
Lin 

F David Copperfield by Dickens 
DICd 

13.3 For larger libraries and those expecting to grow, the Cutter-Sanborn 

tables (available from Libraries Unlimited, Littleton, Colorado) may be 
preferred over letters alone. Numbers from these tables provide the 
greater specificity needed to overcome the inevitable conflicts arising 
when several authors with the same last name write about the same 
topic, several biographies on the same person are acquired, several peo- 
ple with the same name write about an author, or the same person 
writes about an author more than once. 

Selected Bibliography 

14.1 Richard Hyman's Shelf Access in Libraries (Chicago: American 

Library Association, 1982) provides a full discussion of the role of 
library classification in accessing books. A good introduction to the 
nature and characteristics of specific classifications can be found in the 
most recent edition of A. C. Foskett's The Subject Approach to Infor- 
mation (Hamden, Conn.: Linnet Books, 1982) and in Lois M. Chan's 
Cataloging and Classification (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1981). For 
the history of the DDC, see John Comaromi's The Eighteen Editions of 
the Dewey Decimal Classification (Albany, N.Y.: Forest Press, 1976); 
a digested version appeared in The Quarterly Journal of the Library of 
Congress (33:311-331, October 1976), and was included in Bill Katz's 
Library Lit. 8- ; the Best of 1977 (Metuchen: Scarecrow, 1978). For 
development of the Classification through Edition 19, see Jeanne 
Osborn's excellent account in Dewey Decimal Classification, 1 9th Edi- 
tion: A Study Manual (Littleton, Colo.: Libraries Unlimited, 1982). 
Her work is valuable as a study guide to the structure of the DDC and 
as an introduction to the Classification, to the editorial practices that 
govern it, and to the publishing practices regarding it. Rosalind E. 
Miller's and Jane C. Terwillegar's Commonsense Cataloging: A 
Catalogef s Manual, 3rd edition (New York: The H.W. Wilson Co., 
1983) provides a practical introduction to basic principles for the inex- 
perienced classifier. For works on book numbers, see John 
Comaromi's Book Numbers: A Historical Study and Practical Guide 
to Their Use (Littleton, Colo.: Libraries Unlimited, 1981) and Donald 
Lehnus's Book Numbers: History, Principles, and Applications (Chi- 
cago: American Library Association, 1980).

Glossary 



Add note. A note instructing classifiers to append or add digits found elsewhere in the 
Classification to a given base number. 

Add table. See Table (2). 

Application. See Rule of application. 

Approximate the whole. When the topic of a work is approximately coextensive with 
the topic of a DDC heading, the work is said to "approximate the whole." The term is 
also used to characterize works that cover more than half the content of the heading, 
and works that cover representative examples from three or more subdivisions of a 
class. When a work approximates the whole of a subject, standard subdivisions may 
be added for it. Approximating the whole is the opposite of having standing room. 
See also Standing room; Unitary term. 

Artificial digit. A letter or other symbol used optionally as a substitute for digits 0-9 
to provide a more prominent location or shorter notation for various languages, litera- 
tures, religions, cultures, ethnic groups. 

Aspects. Those approaches to a subject that belong to different disciplines, e.g., the 
technical or economic aspects of the manufacture of television sets. See also Dis- 
cipline; Facet; Subject. 

Attraction. See Classification by attraction. 

Author number. See Book number. 

Base number. A number to which other numbers are appended or added. See also 
Add note. 

Bibliographic classification. A fully developed classification system that specifies 
categories down to the finest gradations; it provides the means to relate the categories 
and to specify in the notation all of the aspects and facets of a work. It may be used to 
organize classified subject catalogs as well as libraries. See also Aspects; Facet. 

Bibliothecal classification. See Library classification. 

Book number. That part of a call number that designates a specific item within its 
class. A library using the Cutter-Sanborn system can have D548d indicate David 
Copper field by Dickens (where D stands for the D of Dickens, 548 for "ickens", and 
d for David Copperfield). See also Call number. 

Broad classification. The classification of works in broad categories even when more 
specific numbers are available, e.g., classing a cookbook of Mexican recipes in 641.5 
Cooking (instead of in 641.5972 Mexican cooking). 

Built number. See Number building. 

Call number. A set of letters, numerals, or other symbols (in combination or alone) 
used by a library to identify a specific copy of a work. A call number consists of the 
class number, book number, and sometimes such other data as date, volume number, 
copy number, and location symbol. See also Book number; Class number. 



li 



Dewey Decimal Classification 



Centered entry. An entry representing a subject covered by a span of numbers, e.g., 
372-374 Levels of education. The entry is called "centered" because the span of 
numbers is printed in the center of the page rather than in the number column on the 
left side of the page. Centered entries are identified by the symbol > in the number 
column. 

Characteristic of division. See Facet. 

Citation order. The order in which the facets or characteristics of a class are to be 
combined in number building. For example, juvenile court procedure in the United 
States is expressed in a notation built or synthesized from four facets: 
345/. 7 3/08 1/0269. The citation order for the discipline of law (34) is branch of the 
law (here criminal 5), jurisdiction (here United States 73), topic in the branch of law 
(here juvenile court 081), and standard subdivision (here 0269 procedure). Instruc- 
tions for citation order are provided in the Schedules. When number building is not 
permitted or possible, an order of precedence with respect to the choice of facets or 
characteristics is provided. See also Precedence order. 

Class. (Noun) (1) A group of objects exhibiting one or more common characteristics, 
usually identified by a specific notation. (2) One of the ten major groups numbered 
0-9 of the DDC. Also known as Main class. (3) A subdivision of the DDC of any 
degree of specificity. (Verb) To assign a class number to an individual work. Also 
called Classify. 

Class-elsewhere note. A note instructing the classifier to class parts of a class or topics 
related to it in numbers that are not subdivisions of the number at hand. 

Class-here note. An instruction identifying subjects (both broader and narrower than 
the number) that are to be classed in the given number and in its subdivisions. The 
narrower subjects identified in class-here notes are said to "approximate the 
whole." See also Approximate the whole. 

Class number. Notation that designates the class to which a given item belongs. See 
also Call number. 

Classification. A logical system for the arrangement of knowledge. 

Classification by attraction. The classification of a specific aspect of a subject in an 
inappropriate discipline, usually because the appropriate discipline contains no explicit 
provision for the subject in question. For example, in the 18th and earlier editions of 
the DDC, social services related to water pollution were not provided for in 363, so 
works on this subject were attracted to the engineering numbers in 628. 168. 

Classified catalog. A catalog arranged according to the notational order of a 
classification system (rather than alphabetically). 

Classify. (l)To arrange a collection of items according to a classification system. 
(2) To assign a class number to an individual item. Also called class. 

Close classification. (1) A classification providing for minute subdivision of topics. 
Also called Bibliographic classification. (2) Arrangement of works in conformity 
with the provisions of such a scheme.

Glossary 



Comparative table. When complete or extensive revision has taken place, a compara- 
tive table lists in alphabetical order selected topics with their current number and the 
number used in the previous edition. Found in this edition on pages 496-505 in 
Volume 1. See also Equivalence table; Revision. 

Complete revision. See Revision. 

Complex subject. A complex subject as used in the DDC is a subject that has more 
than one characteristic. For example, the subject "unemployed bibliographers" has 
more than one characteristic (employment status and occupation) and is therefore a 
complex subject. See also Precedence order. 

Comprehensive number. A number (often identified by a comprehensive works note) 
that covers all the components of the subject treated within that discipline. The com- 
ponents may be in a span of consecutive numbers, e.g., Sociology 301-307 
(comprehensive number 301); or distributed in the Classification, e.g., medical diag- 
nosis 616.075, with diagnosis of specific conditions scattered in 616.1-618. See 
also Interdisciplinary number. 

Cross classification. Placing works on the same subject in two different class numbers 
tends to occur when items deal with two or more characteristics of a subject in the 
same class. Instructions in the Schedules should prevent the inconsistency. 

Cross reference. See Class-elsewhere note; See-also references; See references. 

DDC. Dewey Decimal Classification. 

Decimal point. The dot that follows the third digit in a DDC number. In strict usage 
the word "decimal" is not accurate; however, common usage is followed in this 
edition's explanatory material. 

Discipline. An organized field of study or branch of learning, e.g., 200 Religion, 530 
Physics, 364 Criminology. In the DDC, subjects are arranged by disciplines. See 
also Subject. 

Discontinued number. A number from the preceding edition that is no longer used 
because the subject represented by the number is now classed in a more general 
number. Numbers are usually discontinued because they identify a topic with negligi- 
ble current literature or represent a distinction no longer valid in the literature or com- 
mon perception of the field. See also Schedule reduction. 

Division. The first level of subdivision of the ten main classes, represented by the first 
two digits in the notation, e.g., 53 in 530. More often than not the division is a disci- 
pline, e.g., 530 Physics. See also Main class; Section. 

Entry. (1) In the Schedules and Tables: a self-contained unit consisting of a number or 
span of numbers, a heading, and often one or more notes. (2) In the Relative Index: a 
term or phrase followed by a DDC number. 

Equivalence table. When a complete revision has taken place, an equivalence table 
lists in numerical order the classes of the current edition with the equivalent number in 
the former edition (and vice versa). Found in this edition on pages 506-514 in 
Volume 1 . See also Comparative table; Revision.

Dewey Decimal Classification 



Expansion. The development of a class in the Schedules or Tables to provide further 
subdivisions. See also Revision. 

Extensive revision. See Revision. 

Facet. Any of the various categories into which a given class may be divided, e.g., 
division of the class "people" by the categories race, age, education, language spoken, 
and so on. Each category contains terms based on a single characteristic of division, 
e.g., children, adolescents, and adults are characteristics of division of the "ages" 
category. See also Citation order. 

First-of-two rule. The rule instructing that works on two mutually exclusive subjects, 
whether in adjacent or widely separated numbers, are to be classed in the number com- 
ing first in the Schedules or Tables. 

Heading. The word or phrase used as the caption of a given class. 

Hierarchical force. The principle that the attributes of a class that are defined in the 
heading and in certain basic notes apply to all the subdivisions of the class and to all 
other classes to which reference is made. 

Hierarchy. The arrangement of a classification system from general to specific. In the 
Dewey Decimal Classification, the degree of specificity of a class is usually indicated 
by the length of the notation and the corresponding depth of indention of the heading. 

Including note. An enumeration of topics that are not obviously a part of the class and 
that have not been given separate provision. Standard subdivisions may not be added 
to the numbers for these topics. See also Standing room. 

Interdisciplinary number. A number (often identified by an interdisciplinary works 
note) used for works covering a subject from the perspective of more than one disci- 
pline, e.g., the interdisciplinary number for marriage is 306.81 in Sociology. See also 
Comprehensive number. 

Library classification. A classification designed to arrange the physical items of a 
library collection. Also called bibliothecal classification. 

Literary warrant. Justification for the appearance of a class or a topic in the 
Schedules, Tables, or Index, based on the existence of a literature on the topic. 

Main class. One of the ten major subdivisions of the Dewey Decimal Classification, 
represented by the first digit in the notation, e.g., the 3 in 300. See also Division; 
Section. 

Manual. A guide to the use of the DDC that is made up primarily of extended discus- 
sions of problem areas in the application of the Classification. In the Schedules and 
Tables, see-Manual notes indicate where relevant information is available in the 
Manual. The Manual is found in Volume 4. 

Notation. Numerals, letters, and/or other symbols used to represent the main and 
subordinate divisions of a classification scheme. In the DDC, Arabic numerals are 
used to represent the classes, e.g., notation — 07 from Table 1 and 511.3 from the 
Schedules.

Glossary 



Number building. Making a given Schedule number appropriately specific by adding 
notation from the Tables or other parts of the Schedules. See also Citation order. 

Number column. The column of numbers printed in the left margin of the Schedules 
and Tables, and to the right of the alphabetical entries in the Relative Index. 

Order of precedence. See Precedence order. 

Phoenix schedule. No longer used. See Revision (Complete revision). 

Precedence order. The order indicating which one of two or more numbers is to be 
chosen when the numbers represent different characteristics of a subject that cannot be 
shown in full by number building. A note (sometimes containing a table of prece- 
dence) always indicates which characteristic is to be selected for works covering more 
than one characteristic. When the notation can be synthesized to show two or more 
characteristics, it is a matter of citation order. See also Citation order. 

Precedence table. See Precedence order. 

Reduction of Schedules. See Schedule reduction. 

Relative Index. The index to the DDC, called "Relative" because it relates subjects to 
disciplines. In the Schedules, subjects are arranged by disciplines. In the Relative 
Index, subjects are listed alphabetically; indented under them is an alphabetical list of 
the disciplines in which they are found. 

Relocation. The shifting of a topic in a new edition of the DDC from one number to 
another number which differs from the old number in respects other than length, e.g., 
the relocation of cocaine from 362.293 to 362.298. 

Reuse of numbers. A total change in the meaning of a given number from one edition 
to another. Normally numbers are reused only in complete revisions or when the 
reused number has been vacant for two consecutive editions. 

Revision. The result of editorial work that alters the text of any class of the DDC. 
There are four degrees of revision: Routine revision is limited to updating terminol- 
ogy, clarifying notes, and providing modest expansions. Substantial revision involves 
a class that requires major redefinitions and significant relocations. In this edition, the 
revision of 628 Sanitary and municipal engineering is an example of substantial revi- 
sion. Extensive revision involves a major reworking of subdivisions but leaves the 
main outline of the schedule as it was. The changes are shown only through a com- 
parative table rather than through relocation notes in the schedule or table affected. 
There are no extensive revisions in Edition 20. Complete revision (formerly called a 
phoenix) is a new development; the base number remains as in the previous edition, 
but virtually all subdivisions are changed. In this edition, only 780 Music and 
T2 — 711 British Columbia are complete revisions. See also Comparative table. 

Routine revision. See Revision. 

Rule of application. The rule instructing that works about the application of one sub- 
ject to a second subject are classified with the second subject. 

Rule of three. The rule instructing that works that give equal treatment to three or 
more subjects that are all subdivisions of a broader subject are classified in the first 
higher number that includes all of them.

Dewey Decimal Classification 



Scatter note. A class-elsewhere or relocation note that does not lead to a single loca- 
tion, but rather to multiple locations, e.g., at 028.1 Reviews, the classifier is instructed 
to class reviews of works on a specific subject or in a specific discipline with the sub- 
ject or discipline. 

Schedule reduction. The elimination of certain provisions of a previous edition, 
resulting in discontinued numbers. See also Discontinued number. 

Schedules. The series of DDC numbers 001-999, their headings, and instructions or 
notes. They are the core of the DDC and constitute Volumes 2 and 3. 

Section. The third level of subdivision in the Classification, represented by a three- 
digit notation not ending in zero, e.g., 629. See also Division; Main class. 

See-also references. Notes in the Schedules and Tables to classes that are tangentially 
related to the number and that therefore might be confused with it. See-also references 
in the Relative Index may be to a broader term, or simply to any related term. 

See references. A note in the Schedules and Tables introduced by the word "for" that 
leads from the number in which a subject is classed to component parts of the subject 
located elsewhere. See also Class-elsewhere note. 

Separates. Extensive segments of the DDC that are published between editions. 

Standard subdivisions. Subdivisions found in Table 1 that represent frequently recur- 
ring physical forms (dictionaries, periodicals) or approaches (history, research) appli- 
cable to any subject or discipline. They may be added to any number in the Schedules 
unless there are instructions to the contrary. 

Standing room. A term which characterizes topics that are considerably less extensive 
in scope than their class numbers; standard subdivisions cannot be added to these 
topics nor are other number-building techniques allowed. Topics listed in notes begin- 
ning with "contains," "examples," "including," and (usually) "Common names" 
have standing room in the class number, as do other minor topics which are not 
named. To have standing room is the opposite of approximating the whole. See 
also Approximate the whole. 

Subject. An object of study. It may be a person or a group of persons, a thing, place, 
process, activity, abstraction, or any combination of these. It is often studied in more 
than one discipline, e.g., gold is studied in prospecting, mineralogy, jewelry-making, 
minting coins, economics, and dentistry. A class may or may not be a subject. In the 
DDC subject is contrasted with Discipline. Also called topic. 

Substantial revision. See Revision. 

Summary. A listing of the chief subdivisions of a class. Summaries provide a brief 
overview of the structure of the class, and are printed immediately under the entry for 
the class. For the whole Classification, the first, second, and third summaries (of main 
classes, divisions, and sections) appear in Volume 2. 

Synthesis of notation. See Number building. 



hi 



Glossary 



Table. In the DDC, a table of numbers that may be added to other numbers in the 
Schedules to make a class number appropriately specific to the work being classified. 
The numbers found in a table are never used alone. There are two kinds: (1) Tables 
1-7 (always referred to with a capital T) appearing in Volume 1 and representing such 
concepts as geographical area, language, ethnic group, and standard subdivisions. (2) 
Sets of tabulated numbers found in add notes under specific numbers throughout the 
Schedules and occasionally in Tables 1-7. These tabulated numbers are called add 
tables. 

Table of precedence. See Precedence order. 

Topic. See Subject. 

Unitary term. A heading or term in a note containing two or more words joined by 
"and" that have such overlapping meanings that the literature on them is unlikely to 
be clearly separated. In the DDC, unitary terms are treated as single subjects, and 
standard subdivisions may be added for the whole term or for either of its parts. (That 
is, each part of a unitary term is regarded as approximating the whole.) The following 
are examples of unitary terms: 

Religious congregations and orders 
Economic development and growth 
Disputes and conflicts between states 
Educational tests and measurements 

The following are not considered unitary terms: 

Culture and institutions 

Marriage and family 

Interest and discount

Tables 



Use of the Tables 



These are auxiliary tables, and are used only in conjunction with the 
Schedules. In some instances the numbers from one table may be added 
to those of another table, but in all cases the numbers from one or a 
combination of tables are to be used only with appropriate numbers from 
the Schedules. 

The dash preceding each number merely shows that the number never 
stands alone. The dash is omitted when the table number is added to a 
schedule number to make a complete class number. 

Instructions in the use of a particular table precede it. Important 
supplemental instructions for Tables 1,3, and 5 are found in the Manual in 
Volume 4. 

A number in square brackets [ ] is not currently in use. 

A number in parentheses ( ) is an option to standard usage. 



Table 1. Standard Subdivisions 



The following notation is never used alone, but may be used as required with any 
number from the schedules, e.g., classification (—012 in this table) of modern Indie 
languages (491.4): 491.4012. When adding to a number from the schedules, always 
insert a decimal point between the third and fourth digits of the complete number 

If at any given number there are subdivisions having a notation beginning with for a 
special purpose, use 001-009 for standard subdivisions; if notations beginning with 
and 00 both have special purposes, use 0001-0009 for standard subdivisions. In a few 
instances, e.g., at 535.01, there are contrary instructions 

Unless other instructions are given, class works to which two or more standard 
subdivisions are applicable according to the following table of precedence, e.g., 
education and research for specific types of users —07 (not —024):

Table 3. Subdivisions for Individual Literatures, 
for Specific Literary Forms 



Notation from Table 3 is never used alone, but may be used as required with the base 
numbers for individual literatures identified by * under 810-890. It is never used for 
individual literatures not identified by *; the number for works by or about individual or 
multiple authors in such literatures ends with the language notation, e.g., works of an 
author writing in Guaranf 898.3 

Notation from Table 3 may also be used where instructed in 808-809 

Table 3 is divided into three subtables: 

Table 3-A for description, critical appraisal, biography, single or collected works of 
an individual author 

Table 3-B for description, critical appraisal, biography, collected works of two or 
more authors; also for rhetoric in specific literary forms 

Table 3-C for additional elements used in number building within Table 3-B and as 
instructed in 808-809 

Turn to Table 3-A or 3-B for full instructions on building numbers for individual 
literatures, to 808 and 809 for other uses of Table 3-B and 3-C 

See Manual at Table 3 



Table 3-A, Subdivisions for Works by or about 
Individual Authors 



Procedures for building numbers for individual authors: 

1 . Find the base number in the schedule 8 10-890. The base number may be 
identified in a note, e.g., at 820: "Base number for English: 82"; otherwise, it is the 
number given for the literature, e.g., Dutch-language literature 839.31. If there is a 
specific literary form, go to step 2; if not, go to the instructions under —8 in Table 3- 

2. In Table 3-A find the correct subdivision for the literary form, e.g., poetry — 1 
Add this to the base number, e.g., English poetry 821, Dutch poetry 839.31 1. If the 
literary form appears as a subdivision of —8 Miscellaneous writings, go to the 
instructions under —8 in Table 3-A; otherwise, go to step 3 

(continued)

Table 3- A. Subdivisions for Works by or about 
Individual Authors (continued) 

3. Turn back to the appropriate number in the schedule 810-890 to see whether there 
is an applicable period table. If there is one, go to step 4; if not, complete the class 
number by inserting a point between the third and fourth digits, e.g., drama in English by 
a 20th-century New Zealand author 822, Khmer (Cambodian) poetry by a 20th-century 
author 895.9321 

(Option: Where two or more countries share the same language, either [1] use initial 
letters to distinguish the separate countries, or [2] use the special number designated 
for literatures of those countries that are not preferred. Either option makes feasible the 
use of period tables for affiliated literatures, e.g., drama in English by a 20th-century 
New Zealand author NZ822.2 or 828.993322. Full instructions appear under 810, 819, 
820, 828.99, 840.1-848.9, 848.99, 860.1-868.9, 868.99, 869, 869.899. If the option is 
used, go to step 4) 

4. Select the appropriate period number. Add this number to the number already 
derived; always insert a point after the third digit. The class number is complete (except 
for William Shakespeare), since standard subdivisions are never added for individual 
authors, e.g., Spenser's Faerie Queene 821.3 (821 English poetry + 3 Elizabethan period)

Table 3-B. Subdivisions for Works by or about 
More than One Author 



Table 3-B is followed and supplemented by Table 3-C, which provides additional 
elements for building numbers within Table 3-B 

Procedures for building numbers for works by or about more than one author, limited to 
literatures of specific languages: 

1 . Look in the schedule 810-890 to find the base number for the language. The base 
number may be identified in a note, e.g., at 820: "Base number for English: 82"; 
otherwise, it is the number given for the literature, e.g., Dutch-language literature 839.31. 
If there is a specific literary form, go to step 2; if not, skip to step 8 

2. In Table 3-B find the subdivision for the literary form, e.g., poetry — 1 . Add this 
to the base number, e.g., English poetry 821, Dutch poetry 839.31 1. If the literary form 
appears as a subdivision of —8 Miscellaneous writings, go to the instructions under— 8 
in Table 3-B. If the work deals with poetry, drama, fiction, or speech of specific media, 
scopes, kinds for which there is special notation in Table 3-B, e.g., — 1042 sonnets, go to 
step 3. For other works that deal with or fall within a limited time period, skip to step 4; 
for other works not limited by time period, skip to step 7 

3. Use the notation in Table 3-B for the kind of poetry, drama, fiction, or speech, 
e.g., sonnets in English literature 821.042. Insert a point after the third digit. If the term 
for the specific kind of literary form is neither identified by * nor appears in a class-here 
note under a term identified by * the number is complete, e.g., collections of 
English-language clerihews 82 1 .07. If the term for the kind of literary form is identified

4. Turn back to the appropriate number in the schedule 810-890 to see whether there 
is an applicable period table. If there is one, go to step 5; if not, complete the class 
number by inserting a point between the third and fourth digits, e.g., 20th-century drama 
in English by New Zealand authors 822, Khmer (Cambodian) poetry 895.9321 

(Option: Where two or more countries share the same language, either [1] use initial 
letters to distinguish the separate countries, or [2] use the special number designated 
for literatures of those countries that are not preferred. Either option makes feasible the 
use of period tables for affiliated literatures, e.g., 20th-century drama in English by 
New Zealand authors NZ822.2 or 828.993322. Full instructions appear under 810, 
819, 820, 828.99, 840.1-848.9, 848.99, 860.1-868.9, 868.99, 869, 869.899. If the 
option is used, go to step 5) 

5. . Select the appropriate period number. Add this number to the number already 
derived, e.g., English poetry of the Elizabethan period 821.3; always insert a point after 
the third digit. Go to step 6 

6. Under the number for the literary form in Table 3-B, go to the subdivisions for 
specific periods, e.g., under — 1 for poetry go to — 1 1- 19. Follow the instructions given 
there, which will lead to use of the table under — 1-8. For literature displaying specific 
features, literature emphasizing subjects, and literature for and by specific kinds of 
persons, the instructions at — 1-8 will lead to use of Table 3-C, e.g., critical appraisal of 
idealism in English Elizabethan poetry 821.30913 

7. If the work is not limited by time period, go to the first subdivisions under the 
particular form in Table 3-B, e.g., under — 1 for poetry go to — 1001- 1009. Follow the 
instructions given there, which will lead to use of the table under — 1-8. For literature 
displaying specific features, literature emphasizing subjects, and literature for and by 
specific kinds of persons, the instructions at — 1-8 will lead to use of Table 3-C, e.g., 
collections of English poetry about war 821.0080358, collections of English poetry by 
rural authors 821.008091734 

8. If the work is not limited to a specific literary form, consult —01-09 in 
Table 3-B. Follow the instructions at the number selected, making use of Table 3-C 
when specified, e.g., collections of English literature in many forms about holidays 
820.8033. Use period notation 08001-08009 and 09001-09009 only if there is an 
applicable period table

-8 Miscellaneous writings 

Only those forms named below 
Procedures for building numbers: 

1. To the base number for the literature add notation 8, e.g., miscellaneous 
writings in English 828. If the work is limited to a specific time period, go to step 
2; if not, go to step 4 

2. Turn back to the appropriate number in the schedule 810-890 to see 
whether there is an applicable period table. If there is one, go to step 3; if not, go to 
step 4 

(Option: Where two or more countries share the same language, either [1] use 
initial letters to distinguish the separate countries, or [2] use the special number 
designated for literatures of those countries that are not preferred. This option 
makes feasible the use of period tables for affiliated literatures, e.g., 
miscellaneous writings in English by 20th-century New Zealand authors 
NZ828.2 or 828.993382. Full instructions appear under 810, 819, 820, 828.99, 
840.1-848.9, 848.99, 860.1-868.9, 868.99, 869, 869.899. If the option is used, 
go to step 3) 

3. Select the appropriate period number, e.g., the Victorian period in the 
English literature of Great Britain 8. Then follow the instructions under— 81-89 

4. If the work is not limited to a specific time period, or if there is no 
applicable period table, consider whether the work is limited to one of the forms of 
miscellaneous writing listed in —802-808. If it is limited to one of those forms, go 
to step 5; if not, complete the class number by inserting a point between the third 
and fourth digits, e.g., miscellaneous writings in Russian from many time periods 
891.78, miscellaneous writings in English by 20th-century New Zealand authors 
828, miscellaneous writings in Khmer (Cambodian) by 20th-century authors 
895.9328 

5. Class the work in the appropriate number from the span —802-808, then 
complete the number by inserting a point between the third and fourth digits, e.g., 
prose literature in Russian from many time periods 891.7808, prose literature in 
English by 20th-century New Zealand authors 828.08, prose literature in Khmer

Table 5. Racial, Ethnic, National Groups 



The following numbers are never used alone, but may be used as required (either directly 
when so noted or through the interposition of notation 089 from Table 1 ) with any 
number from the schedules, e.g., ethnopsychology (155.84) of the Japanese (—956 in this 
table): 155.84956; ceramic arts (738) of Jews (—924 in this table): 738.089924. They 
may also be used when so noted with numbers from other tables, e.g., notation 174 from 
Table 2 

Except where instructed otherwise, and unless it is redundant, add to the number from 
this table and to the result add notation 1-9 from Table 2, e.g., Germans in Brazil 
—31081, but Germans in Germany —31. Add notation from Table 2 if appropriate even 
when the group discussed does not approximate the whole of the group specified by the 
number in Table 5, if the number in Table 5 is limited to speakers of only one language, 
e.g., Bavarians in Brazil —31081, but the Maya in Guatemala —974 

Except where instructed otherwise, give precedence first to ethnic group, second to 
nationality, last to basic races, e.g., United States citizens of Serbian descent —91822073 
{not — 1 3), United States citizens of the Caucasian race — 1 3 {not —034073). In this table 
"ethnic group" most often means a group with linguistic ties, but it can also mean a 
group with cultural or racial ties. The numbers for basic races are used only for works 
treating races as extremely broad categories. Thus notation 036 Negro race is used for 
works treating Black peoples of African and Asian or Oceanian origin as belonging to the 
same race, but —96 is used for Black peoples of African origin 

Except where instructed otherwise, when choosing between two ethnic groups, give 
precedence to the group for which the notation is different from that for the nationality of 
the people, e.g., a work treating equally the Hispanic and native American heritage of 
bilingual Spanish-Guarani mestizos of Paraguay —983 {not —68892) 

Except where instructed otherwise, when choosing between two national groups, give 
precedence to the former or ancestral national group, e.g., people from the Soviet Union 
who have become United States citizens —917073 {not — 13)
